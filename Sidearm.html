                    The Classic is a pistol that all players receive upon spawning. It has two firing modes, a standard semi-automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic shotgun alternate fire that fires three bullets instantly but only at around a third of its usual fire rate.

                    The Shorty is the cheapest purchasable weapon in the game. As a sidearm equivalent of a shotgun, it is most effective at short range to instantly take an enemy by surprise. With good damage and functionality despite its low price tag, it can even be used to catch out a fully-bought enemy in eco rounds, allowing the player to gain a powerful weapon upgrade for very little investment.

                    The Frenzy is a low-cost automatic pistol. As a sidearm equivalent of an SMG, it's not too punishing to use on the move at short ranges, making it most effective at that range and the best sidearm to use in such scenarios, though to challenge enemies who have full-bought getting headshots will most likely be necessary.

                    The Sheriff is a semi-automatic revolver and the most expensive sidearm in the game. Able to kill enemies with a single bullet to the head at most ranges and health totals, it can be used to challenge even enemies who have full-bought. It's high penetration and extra reserve magazine also makes it useful for spamming for wallbangs during pistol or eco rounds. With a low-capacity magazine and low fire rate however, even one missed shot can end up being punishing. The Sheriff's high recoil and spread also promotes exceptional control and precision in order to use it when fighting multiple enemies.
